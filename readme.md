# WhatsApp Bulk Media & Message Sender 📱🚀

A Node.js-based script that uses [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) to **send bulk media and messages** automatically to a list of phone numbers.
---
## 📦 Features

- Send **media files** (images, videos, documents, APKs, etc.) to multiple numbers.
- Send **custom text messages** alongside the media.
- Simple **confirmation prompt** before sending.
- Uses **Local Authentication** to save sessions (no QR scan needed every time).
- Built-in **error handling** and **rate limiting** to avoid being banned.

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

3. **Prepare Your Media**
    - Place your media file (image, video, APK, etc.) in the `/media` folder.
    - Update the media file path in the script:
      ```javascript
      const mediaPath = './media/your-file-name.extension';
      ```

4. **Update Phone Numbers**
    - Edit the phone numbers list in **international format** (with `+countrycode`) inside the script:

## ⚡ Important Notes

- ✅ Use real phone numbers with WhatsApp accounts registered.
- ✅ The first message sent should not look spammy to avoid WhatsApp banning.
- ✅ Add delays (already added 2s delay) between messages to prevent rate-limiting.
- ✅ Media file must exist and path must be correct.
- ❌ Do **NOT** use for spam or unsolicited messages. This may **violate WhatsApp's Terms of Service**.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Q: What happens if authentication fails?**
  - The script will exit automatically. You might need to clear `~/.wwebjs_auth` folder and try again.

- **Q: Can I send only text messages without media?**
  - Yes. Simply comment out the media sending line inside `sendMessages()`.

- **Q: Can I schedule messages?**
  - No, this script sends immediately after confirmation. For scheduling, you would need to integrate a cron job.
